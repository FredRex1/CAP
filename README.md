## Key Points
- Purpose of our project is to construct a user portal that provide clients with an user interface to manage their document reports
- The login system must approve access to either the client or the internal user, which then can begin their session with the program
- Some of the resources required to learn include cloud computing, web development, and SQL

## About PARATUS
“Semper Paratus” means "always ready." That philosophy, coupled with their desire to be genuine partners with each of their clients, is the core principle on which the company was founded. When they team up with a client, they align themselves with their mission. The clients' business is their business. 
Paratus leverages their data analytics capabilities to provide tailored data analytics to each client and to constantly monitor and update their operational effectiveness. 
But most importantly, they are extremely proud of their technological expertise, but the real Paratus difference is with their team.

## Goals and Objectives
- Create a full-stack web app from scratch and create a login page for clients and internal users, where user roles will define the content they have access to. Internal Users will be PARATUS employees that will have access to Client Users for customer support.
- Create an interface that allows users to manage their reports, where they will be able to see it on demand and allow/restrict access to it.
- Create an interface that gives users the ability to schedule and email reports as attachments with different access levels.
